# Security Policy

## Reporting a Security Issue

If you discover a security issue with my portfolio site, please help us by disclosing the issue to us responsibly. 

**Please do not create a public GitHub issue or forum post.**

Instead, report it to me privately via email at [jayborad368@gmail.com](mailto:jayborad368@gmail.com). You can use my [PGP key](link-to-your-pgp-key) to encrypt your message.

## Response and Disclosure

Once the issue is reported, I will do my best to acknowledge the receipt of the report within 48 hours. I will work to validate the issue and keep you informed about the progress of its resolution.

I will make all efforts to address the issue as quickly as possible. If a patch or solution is developed, I will notify you, and work together to determine an appropriate disclosure timeline.

## Out-of-Scope Issues

While I appreciate the responsible disclosure of security issues, please note that the following issues are considered out of scope:

- Any security issues or vulnerabilities related to third-party services, libraries, or software not directly maintained by me.
- Security issues that require physical access to the server hosting the portfolio site.
- Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.
- Issues that are not reproducible, well-documented, or do not pose a significant risk.
- Issues that are the result of user error, such as misconfiguration.

## Thank You

Your assistance in responsibly disclosing security issues is highly appreciated. It helps ensure the safety and integrity of my portfolio site. Your responsible disclosure helps maintain a secure online presence for everyone who visits the site.

Thank you for your cooperation and for making the Internet a safer place.
